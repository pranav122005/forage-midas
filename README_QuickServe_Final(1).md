# ⚡ QuickServe

### A simple, reliable way to request, assign, track, and complete local services.

**Customer → Request → Smart Dispatch → Agent → Completion**

QuickServe is a full-stack service management platform built with
Flutter and Supabase. Customers create service requests, field service
agents manage and complete jobs, and administrators maintain operational
control from a web portal.

## ✦ Overview

QuickServe is an end-to-end **service request and dispatch platform**
for everyday local services.

Instead of requiring customers to make phone calls, wait without
updates, or face unpredictable dispatch, QuickServe turns service
delivery into a connected, transparent workflow.

Supported Service Categories:

-   ❄️ **AC Servicing**
-   🔧 **Plumbing**
-   ⚡ **Electrical**
-   🧹 **Cleaning**

Every request is stored securely, matched with an eligible service agent
using spatial proximity and availability, and tracked in real time until
completion.

-   **Customers**: Request, schedule, and track services from their
    mobile app.
-   **Service Agents**: Receive, accept, and fulfill jobs from their
    field mobile app.
-   **Administrators**: Control requests, agents, customers, and
    operational assignments via the web portal.

> **Key Principle:** *The app handles the experience. The backend
> remains the authority.*

Authentication, authorization, dispatch, assignment, and state
transitions are enforced by Supabase database policies (RLS) and
PostgreSQL RPCs rather than trusting client state.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## ✦ Why QuickServe?

Finding a qualified service provider is only step one. A real-world
operational service platform must also manage:

-   Agent availability and operational radius
-   Automated candidate dispatch with response windows
-   Live status tracking and location privacy
-   Operational payment recording
-   Multi-role permission boundaries

QuickServe models a service request as a continuous lifecycle:

``` text
Create → Dispatch → Offer → Accept → Start → Complete
```

This structure gives customers visibility, agents a streamlined
workflow, and administrators operational oversight.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

                    Smart Dispatch
```

### 1. Request Creation

The customer picks a service, fills out details, specifies an address
with map coordinates, sets a preferred date/time, and chooses priority.

Every request generates a tracking code such as:

`REQ-2026-000123`

### 2. Backend Agent Selection

The backend spatial engine evaluates eligible candidates based on:

-   Agent availability and verification
-   Distance within the configured radius (`10 km – 20 km`, default
    `15 km`)
-   Capability matching for the requested service
-   Current workload balancing

### 3. Agent Offer Window

When a candidate is identified, a temporary offer is created with a
response window of approximately **120 seconds**. Supabase Realtime
pushes relevant offer changes to the agent's screen. If an offer is
rejected or expires, the dispatch workflow can continue to another
eligible candidate.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## ✦ Request Lifecycle

QuickServe enforces controlled request state transitions:

``` text
┌──────────┐
│ PENDING  │
└────┬─────┘
     │
     ▼
┌──────────────┐
│ DISPATCHING  │
└────┬─────────┘
     │
     ▼
┌──────────┐
│ ASSIGNED │
└────┬─────┘
     │
     ▼
┌─────────────┐
│ IN_PROGRESS │
└────┬────────┘
     │
     ▼
┌───────────┐
│ COMPLETED │
└───────────┘
```

Eligible requests may also be cancelled.

-   Terminal states (`COMPLETED`, `CANCELLED`) are protected from
    accidental reassignment.
-   Assignment state and request state are tracked separately.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## ✦ Smart Dispatch

Dispatch logic runs server-side to maintain authoritative eligibility
and protect against race conditions:

``` text
Workload Check
      │
      ▼
Spatial Proximity (PostGIS)
      │
      ▼
Deterministic Agent ID Ranking
      │
      ▼
Temporary Offer
```

-   **PostGIS Spatial Queries**: Uses `ST_DWithin` with geography data
    to match request locations against eligible agent coordinates.
-   **Eligibility**: Availability, verification, service capability,
    current location, and configured radius.
-   **Candidate Ordering**: Workload ascending, distance ascending, then
    deterministic agent ID tie-breaker.
-   **Concurrency Control**: Database locking with
    `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` helps prevent concurrent dispatch
    operations from reserving the same candidate incorrectly.
-   **Offer Expiry**: Offers use an approximately 120-second response
    window.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## ✦ Real-Time Location & Privacy

QuickServe balances operational real-time tracking with strict privacy
rules:

``` text
Offer Pending / Not Accepted
      │
      ▼
Customer Tracking Disabled
      │
      ▼
Agent Accepts / Active Job
      │
      ▼
Authorized Live GPS Tracking
      │
      ▼
Job Completed / Cancelled
      │
      ▼
Live Tracking Access Ends
```

-   Device GPS is used during active service workflows.
-   Customers do not receive unrestricted agent location access.
-   Unlimited historical GPS tracking is intentionally excluded.
-   Agent operational location is controlled through backend
    authorization and request state.

                           │
                           ▼
                  ┌──────────────────┐
                  │service_assignments│
                  └─────────┬────────┘
                            │
              ┌─────────────┼─────────────┐
              ▼             ▼             ▼
       request history   locations     payments
```

### Core Tables

-   `profiles`: Core user record linked to `auth.users` with role
    identifiers (`customer`, `agent`, `admin`).
-   `agent_profiles`: Agent operational availability, service radius,
    verification, and agent-specific information.
-   `service_requests`: Customer requests, lifecycle status, service
    details, and geographic location.
-   `service_assignments`: Agent/request relationships, offer state,
    assignment state, and timestamps.
-   `agent_locations`: Current operational agent GPS positions using
    PostGIS geography.
-   `payments`: Payment records including amount, currency, method,
    status, and timestamps.
-   `request_status_history`: Request state transition history.

Detailed database documentation: [docs/DATABASE.md](docs/DATABASE.md)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## ✦ Security

### 1. Backend Authorization & RLS

Client-side role representations are treated as UI state only. Database
operations are protected by Row Level Security policies and backend
authorization checks.

``` text
Flutter
   │
   ▼
Supabase Auth
   │
   ▼
Authenticated Session
   │
   ▼
PostgreSQL RLS / RPC Authorization
```

### 2. Protected Administrative RPCs

Critical administrative operations such as manual agent assignment
execute through protected functions such as
`admin_assign_service_request()`, which validates the authenticated
user's role before performing the operation.

### 3. Client Role Spoofing Prevention

During physical-device testing, a development-only client-side role
switcher was identified as a source of UI/backend role desynchronization
and removed.

The authoritative role flow is:

``` text
Supabase Auth
      ↓
public.profiles
      ↓
Authoritative Role
      ↓
Flutter Auth State
      ↓
UI / Route Access
```

### 4. Credential & Environment Protection

-   Only public client configuration (`SUPABASE_URL` and public
    anon/publishable key) is used in the Flutter application.
-   Service-role keys, database passwords, and private secrets are never
    placed in the client.
-   `.env` is excluded from Git.
-   `.env.example` contains only safe configuration placeholders.

Detailed security documentation: [docs/SECURITY.md](docs/SECURITY.md)

## ✦ Screens / Visuals

The repository contains the QuickServe visual assets and product
showcase under:

``` text
docs/assets/
```

The main animated and static product showcases are:

-   `quickserve-hero.gif`
-   `quickserve-hero.png`

Recommended application screenshots can also be added under
`docs/assets/` without changing the application architecture.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## ✦ Hosting

QuickServe Flutter Web is configured for **Firebase Hosting**.

``` text
Flutter Web
    │
    ▼
Firebase Hosting
    │
    ▼
QuickServe Web Admin Portal
    │
    ▼
Supabase
```

-   **Frontend**: Firebase Hosting serves the Flutter Web single-page
    application.
-   **Backend**: Supabase remains responsible for authentication,
    PostgreSQL, PostGIS, RLS, RPCs, and Realtime.
-   Firebase is used only for web hosting; the Flutter application does
    not use Firebase as its application backend.

### Build Web

``` bash
flutter build web --release
```

### Firebase Hosting

After Firebase CLI authentication and project configuration:

``` bash
firebase login
firebase init hosting
firebase deploy --only hosting
```

For Flutter Web, configure the Firebase Hosting public directory as:

``` text
build/web
```

and enable the SPA rewrite to:

``` text
/index.html
```
